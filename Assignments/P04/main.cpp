 *      Each node keeps a flag to know if a word ends 
 *      at its location and will create and point to
 *      26 individual pointers, each one representing
 *      a letter of the alphabet to move to for the next
 *      letter in the word. 
 * 
 * Public Methods:
 *      - TrieNode()
 * 
 * Private Methods:
 *      - None
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *  TrieNode Q;

/**
 * Trie
 *
 * Description:
 *      A Trie Tree class to hold the words from the txt file. The trie
 *      stores words by its individual letters pointing to a TrieNode containing
 *      the next letter in the word. When the last letter of a word is added to 
 *      the Trie tree, then the node for that letter will be marked true as a word
 *      to indicate that a word ends at this TrieNode. When a given word is typed
 *      the user, the class can determine how many substrings match the given word
 *      and store the words in a vector to print out the first ten matching words
 *      and the total numbers of matches found overall in the Trie tree.
 *      
 *
 * Public Methods:
 *      - Trie()
 *      - void Insert(string)
 *      - int find_all(string)
 *      - void PrintSuggested()

 * Private Methods:
