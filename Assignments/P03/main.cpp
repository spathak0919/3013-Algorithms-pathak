    *    library in which it total the ascii value of the typed word with the 
    *    matching substring of the tree's word. It then subtracts the two values.
    *    If the strings match then the value will be 0 and the tree branches off
    *    both left and right to continue to see if more matches are nearby. If
    *    the subtracted value is a negative number then the dictionary word is
